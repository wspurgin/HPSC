      "Interestingly, over all, Newton's method was close to 10 times faster than Lagrange and never took longer than 0.16 seconds to both calculate the coefficients and evaluate the polynomial.

      "\n",
      "The main reason for Legrange's higher times is the cost of evaluation the lagrange bases. While calculating the lagrange coefficients is constant time (since they are just the function values at that point which are provided), the cost of evaluating the basis is $O(n^2)$, and the cost of calculating that basis is $O(n)$. The cost for evaluating using the Newton's method is $O(n)$ while the coefficents (in general) is $O(n^2)$. In my experiment, even though the cost of calculating the coefficients for Newton's method is $O(n^3)$ which is large, Newton's method is still faster. Having found these results, it would have been better if I had found the Newton Coefficients using an alternate method to make Newton's method faster still. It goes to show how the evaluation portion of the interpolantion methods factor into the runtime far more than the calculation of the coefficients."

As can be seen above, instead of calculating one basis, we calculate the basis of x and basis of y, then taking their product and the product of our lagrange coefficient to get the interpolant value. In terms of algorithmic cost, recall that from part 1, the cost of evaluating the lagrange basis in 1D was $O(n^2)$. Now we are evaluating two lagrange bases in 2D, so then effictively even though the upper bound is now effectively $O(n^3)$ Since vectors x and y are the same length n, we iterate through all their elements ($n^2$) and calculate the lagrange basis (which takes n operations) for each vector x and y. Therefore the whole opearations take $n^2(2n) = 2(n^3) \\Rightarrow O(n^3)$\n",
